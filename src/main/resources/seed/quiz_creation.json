In the `main` function, a `Derived` object `d` is created, and a pointer `ptr` of type `Base` points to the `Derived` object. When `ptr->print()` is called, the `Derived` class's `print` method is invoked due to dynamic polymorphism, resulting in the output 'Derived'.",

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, governing how web servers and clients interact. Explore key aspects such as request methods, status codes, headers, and more.\n\n## About the Quiz\n\nThis quiz covers essential topics including:\n- HTTP request methods and their purposes\n- HTTP status codes and their meanings\n- Headers and their role in HTTP communication\n\nEnhance your knowledge and grasp the core principles of HTTP with carefully crafted questions that bridge theoretical understanding with practical application.\n\nAre you ready to dive into the world of HTTP?
